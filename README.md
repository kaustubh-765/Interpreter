# JLox Interpreter
<p>The JLox interpreter is an implementation of the Lox programming language, developed as part of the "Crafting Interpreters" book by Bob Nystrom. This interpreter serves as a practical example to understand the concepts of language design and interpreter implementation.</p>

## Features:
- Dynamic Typing: Lox is a dynamically typed language, allowing flexible variable usage without explicit type declarations.

- Object-Oriented Programming: Lox supports object-oriented programming paradigms, including classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

- Control Structures: The interpreter includes essential control structures such as if statements and loops to facilitate program flow control.

- Functions and Closures: Lox supports the creation and usage of functions, including support for closures, allowing encapsulation of state within functions.

- Garbage Collection: JLox includes automatic garbage collection to manage memory allocation and deallocation.

- Error Handling: The interpreter provides error reporting and handling mechanisms to aid in debugging and improving code reliability.

- Interactive REPL: JLox includes an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) that allows users to input and execute Lox code interactively.

## Getting Started:
To get started with the JLox interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

3. Compile the JLox source code using your preferred Java compiler.

4. Run the JLox interpreter, providing Lox code files or entering code interactively in the REPL.

For detailed instructions, examples, and further documentation, refer to the "Crafting Interpreters" book or the provided resources.

* Or

You can directly run the file using the provided Runnable JAR file. 

```bash
java -jar jlox.jar <file_name>.lox
```
